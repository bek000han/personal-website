                                As part of the Computer Science course, I had been assigned a client, whom gave me 
                                instructions for a program he desired. I created a CRM software in Python, which could manipulate
                                and modify a number of entities, with other features like a notification system were included too.
                            </p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <br>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
